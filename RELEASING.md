# Releasing Grape::OAS

This document describes the release process for the grape-oas gem.

## Pre-Release Checks

Before releasing, ensure:

1. All tests pass locally and in CI:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   bundle exec rake
   ```

2. The CHANGELOG.md is up to date with all changes since the last release.

3. The version number in `lib/grape_oas/version.rb` is correct.

## Release Steps

### Automated Release Process

1. **Update the version** in `lib/grape_oas/version.rb` to the release version

2. **Prepare the CHANGELOG**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake release:prerelease
   ```
   This task will:
   - Replace "Unreleased" with the version number and today's date
   - Remove any "Your contribution here" placeholder lines
   - Commit with message "Preparing for release vX.X.X"

   **Note**: The task is idempotent - safe to run multiple times.

3. **Push and create the release**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   bundle exec rake release
   ```
   This will:
   - Build the gem
   - Create a git tag
   - Push the tag to GitHub
   - Push the gem to RubyGems.org

## Post-Release

You can automate the post-release preparation with:

```bash
bundle exec rake release:postrelease
git push origin main
```

This task will:
- Bump the patch version in `lib/grape_oas/version.rb`
- Ensure CHANGELOG.md has an "Unreleased" section
- Commit the changes with message "Prepare for next development iteration"

**Note**: The task is idempotent - safe to run multiple times without duplicating work.

   - Add "Unreleased" section to CHANGELOG.md
   - Bump version in `lib/grape_oas/version.rb`

2. **Commit post-release changes**:
   ```bash
   git add CHANGELOG.md lib/grape_oas/version.rb
   git commit -m "Prepare for next development iteration"
   git push origin main
   ```
